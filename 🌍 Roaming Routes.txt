🌍 Travel & Tour Management Web Application (Full-Stack Project)

I’m excited to share my full-stack Travel Management System developed using PHP, MySQL, and integrated third-party services. This project allows users to explore destinations, manage bookings, and perform secure payments, while providing an admin panel to control the entire platform.

🔹 Key Features:
• User-friendly travel destination browsing interface
• Admin dashboard to manage users and destinations
• Secure online payment integration using Razorpay
• Email notifications using PHPMailer
• Modular structure with reusable components (header, footer, includes)
• MySQL database design for efficient data handling

🔹 Tech Stack:
• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
• Backend: Core PHP
• Database: MySQL
• Payment Gateway: Razorpay API
• Email Service: PHPMailer

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of full-stack web development, payment gateway integration, database management, and building real-world scalable web applications.
